# Guess The Number Game

## Overview
"Guess The Number" is a simple Python-based game where the player has to guess a random number between 1 and 1000. The game provides clues about the size of the number, and the player has 10 chances (lifelines) to guess it correctly.

## Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 1000.
- The player receives hints based on the number's digit count (single, two, three, or four digits).
- 10 lifelines to make guesses.
- Score calculated based on remaining lifelines.
- Option to exit the game.

## Instructions
1. Run the program.
2. Select "1" to start the game or "2" to exit.
3. The program will generate a random number, and you will have 10 chances to guess it.
4. After each guess, you will receive feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.
5. The game ends either when you guess the correct number or run out of lifelines.

## How to Run
To run the program, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python GuessNumber.py
