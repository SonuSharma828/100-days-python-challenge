# Secret Language Encoder/Decoder

This Python program allows you to encode and decode secret messages by rearranging characters and adding random letters for security. Messages with three or more characters are encoded with random padding, while shorter ones are reversed. Use the options to encode or decode any message.

## Features:
- Encode messages by shifting and adding random characters.
- Decode messages by removing the added characters.
- Simple user interface.

### Usage:
1. Enter your choice:
    - 1 to Encode a message.
    - 2 to Decode a message.
    - 3 to Exit the program.

2. Input the message to either encode or decode.

3. The result will be displayed after processing.
