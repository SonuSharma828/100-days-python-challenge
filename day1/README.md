# 100 Days of Python: Day 1 - Typing Speed Test

This is the first program of the 100 days Python challenge. It's a simple typing speed test program that measures how fast you can type and checks for errors.

## Project Overview
- The program uses the `time` module to record the time taken by the user to type a given paragraph.
- The `random` module is used to select a random test paragraph.
- The user's typing speed is calculated in characters per second, and errors are counted by comparing the test paragraph and the user's input.

## Required Python Modules
- `time`: This module is built into Python, so no need for installation.
- `random`: This is also a built-in module in Python.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the Python script.
3. Run the script with the following command:
   ```bash
   python TypingTest.py
